# Autoencoder-relay-AWGN-ROB
Accompanying codes of paper "Deep Autoencoder Learning for Relay-Assisted Cooperative Communication Systems" by Yuxin Lu, Peng Cheng, Zhuo Chen, Yonghui Li, Wai Ho Mow, and Branka Vucetic. 

In this repository, we show how to implement the relay-assisted cooperative communication system as one autoencoder. As the conventional end-to-end training is inapplicable, we use a novel two-stage training approach to indirectly solve the end-to-end training problem.
Including the python codes for implementing the autoencoders for a point to point AWGN channel and the 3-node relay network under AWGN channels (Fig. 2 in the paper).
